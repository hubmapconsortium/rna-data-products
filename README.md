# rna-data-products
A Python and CWL pipeline for concatenating HuBMAP RNA-seq [Salmon] data into data products per organ and one large RNA-seq [Salmon] data product.
## Pipeline steps
* Create a UUIDs TSV file with all UUIDs and HuBMAP IDs of public processed data wanted for the run.
* With the UUIDs TSV, create a data directory of all H5ADs needed for the run.
* Make an AWS access key id and a secret access key to upload the files to S3 bucket.
* Annotate and concatenate a raw data product and a processed data product.
